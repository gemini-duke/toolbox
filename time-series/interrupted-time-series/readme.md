# Interrupted time series analysis

The interrupted time series (ITS) study design is a powerfull tool that can aid researchs to understand the impact of an intervention in a given outcome. ITS is a great alternative when randomized control trials (RCTs) can not be applied either because of lack of control groups or due to population-level interventions.

The ITS design is particularlt suited to interventions that are applied in a **population level** (local, regional, state...) and that take place over a **clearly defined time period**.

In addition, the ITS design is better suited to interventions that lead to relatively quick changes in the outcome.

Both `interrupted_time_series_presentation.Rmd` and `interrupted_time_series_presentation.html` are the R markdown and html version of the presentation made by [@souzajvp](https://github.com/souzajvp) in october 7th. The presentation contains a brief introduction on ITS analysis and focuses mainly on the segmented (piecewise) regression method, but also touches on ARIMA. 

The data sets and codes used here are largely derived from two great publications that discuss ITS focused on health data:
1. [Interrupted time series regression for the evaluation of public health interventions: a tutorial ](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/27283160/);
2. [Interrupted time series analysis using autoregressive integrated moving average (ARIMA) models: a guide for evaluating large-scale health interventions](https://bmcmedresmethodol.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s12874-021-01235-8);
