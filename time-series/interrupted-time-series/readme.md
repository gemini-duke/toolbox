# Interrupted time series analysis

The interrupted time series (ITS) study design is a powerfull tool that can aid researchs to understand the impact of an intervention in a given outcome. ITS is a great alternative when randomized control trials (RCTs) can not be applied either because of lack of control groups or due to population-level interventions.

The ITS design is particularlt suited to interventions that are applied in a **population level** (local, regional, state...) and that take place over a **clearly defined time period**.

In addition, the ITS design is better suited to interventions that lead to relatively quick changes in the outcome.
